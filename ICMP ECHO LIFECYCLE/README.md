A simple ping command was run from host → target (8.8.8.8). Wireshark captured the ICMP traffic generated by this test.
Packet 1 is a Type 8 echo request sent from Source Host IP 192.168.64.5 to the target of 8.8.8.8. This packet has a an identifier of 2 and a sequence number of 1. 
Packet 2 is a Type 0 echo request sent from the target 8.8.8.8 to the Host IP of 192.168.64.5 with an identifier of 2 and a sequence number of 1.

These requests have a normal use for Connectivity testing and troubleshooting network paths.

It can be used maliciously for: Network Reconnaissance (host discovery, scanning), ICMP tunneling for data exfiltration and covert channels bypassing firewalls.

When ICMP traffic is observed:
Validate whether it’s expected (admin troubleshooting) or anomalous (suspicious scanning).
Pivot to frequency, destination, and timing patterns.
Correlate with endpoint logs to confirm intent.
